<h3 id="the-central-paradox-of-computing">The Central Paradox of Computing</h3>
<p>Richard Feynman came of age when the abacus and the slide-rule were still tools of standard practice, and the earliest calculators were refrigerator-sized machines that consumed 30 minutes per calculation. As such, as (perhaps) is natural, Feynman made a habit of doing calculations in his head, and became quick enough at them to beat the abacus.</p>
<p>This may seem like a trivial matter. One might even suppose that science might be marginally better off if Feynman had access to a TI-84 (or MATLAB), thus freeing his mental capacities to focus on the big picture.</p>
<p>(Hit the down arrow)</p>
</section><section>
<p>But there are indications that exactly the <em>opposite</em> is true. Feynman credits his extensive practice in number crunching with a deepened intuition for how the physical world worked. He even is reputed to have had an intuition for the fourth dimension, which he says arose from solving lots of algebra problems in adolescence. Would his genius have ripened fully if he had had today&rsquo;s technological tools?</p>

<p>Google&rsquo;s power of instant recall is said to free up cognitive capacity for doing more &ldquo;human&rdquo; things, like connecting the material. <em>But what if memory is integral to the process of making connections?</em></p>
<p>Calculators spare time in tedium to concentrate on grander parts of mathematics. <em>But what if the big stuff comes from intuition gained from the little stuff?</em></p>

<p>And this gives rise to the merits of plain text&hellip;</p>
</section><section>
<p><em>Working in plain text is the closest the modern computer user can come to Feynman&rsquo;s manual computation.</em></p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t instill intuitions about math, but it does mandate a certain <em>attitude</em> towards life and technological convenience. Plain text can replicate most all of modern computing &ndash; but doing the replication is a manual process, in which one must understand the steps.</p>
</section><section>
<p>This could be called the <em>maker&rsquo;s attitude</em>: the attitude of Feynman towards his field; a fierce desire to understand everything from the core, with no shortcuts.</p>
